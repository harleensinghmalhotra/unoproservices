  "content": "<h2>Why Chicago Yards Flood So Easily</h2><p>Chicago’s natural soil is dense clay, which absorbs water very slowly. Combine this with flat yards, downspouts that dump water too close to the foundation, and poorly graded landscapes, and you have a recipe for standing water. Over time, this can lead to mold, foundation cracking, dying plants, and mosquito problems.</p><h2>Solution #1: French Drains</h2><p>A French drain is a subsurface drainage system that redirects water away from your home. It consists of a perforated pipe wrapped in fabric, surrounded by clean gravel. When installed correctly, it collects water from saturated soil and transports it to a safe discharge point. French drains are ideal for yards with consistently wet soil or pooling water after storms.</p><h2>Solution #2: Regrading the Yard</h2><p>Sometimes drainage issues can be fixed by reshaping the land. Grading creates a smooth, subtle slope that directs water away from your home. Chicago homes built decades ago often have settled soil, causing the yard to slope toward the foundation. Correcting grade restores proper water flow and prevents basement leaks.</p><h2>Solution #3: Permeable Paver Systems</h2><p>Permeable patios and walkways allow rainwater to pass directly through the surface and into a stone base below. Instead of creating runoff, permeable systems absorb water naturally. They are perfect for homeowners who want a functional patio that also solves drainage problems.</p><h2>Which Solution Is Right for You?</h2><p>Most drainage problems require a combination of these methods. A professional assessment helps determine the exact cause and best long-term fix. When done properly, drainage improvements can drastically increase the usability and health of your backyard.</p><p><strong>If your yard floods every spring, we can design a custom drainage plan tailored to your property.
