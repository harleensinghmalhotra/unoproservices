  "title": "Weekly vs. Bi-Weekly Lawn Mowing: Which Schedule Is Best for Chicago Lawns?",
  "intro": "For homeowners across Chicagoland, maintaining a lush, healthy lawn is a point of pride. But one of the most common questions we hear is about frequency: should you mow every week or every other week? The right answer depends on your lawn's specific needs, the unpredictable Illinois weather, and your long-term goals for your property.",

  "content": "<h2>The Growth Cycle of a Classic Chicago Lawn</h2>\n<p>Most lawns in Illinois, from the North Shore to the southern suburbs, are a blend of cool-season grasses like Kentucky bluegrass and fescue. These grasses thrive in the spring and fall, growing rapidly when temperatures are mild and rainfall is consistent.</p><p>During the peak heat of a Chicago summer, their growth naturally slows. Understanding this cycle is the first step in creating the right mowing plan for your property.</p>\n\n<h2>The Case for Weekly Lawn Mowing</h2>\n<p>A consistent weekly mowing schedule is the gold standard for promoting a dense, healthy turf. By following the \"one-third rule\"—never removing more than one-third of the grass blade at a time—you avoid shocking the plant and stressing its root system.</p><p>This helps the lawn fight off weeds, pests, and disease. The finer clippings from a weekly cut also decompose easily, acting as a natural fertilizer. This is the schedule we recommend for homeowners in Cook County who want that pristine, professionally manicured look.</p>\n\n<h2>When Bi-Weekly Mowing Makes Sense</h2>\n<p>A bi-weekly schedule can be a practical, budget-friendly option under specific conditions. It's most suitable during the slower growth phase of mid-summer (July and August) or for lawns with significant shade that naturally grow slower.</p><p>However, there are trade-offs. Letting grass get too long between cuts can lead to clumping, thatch buildup, and a stressed lawn when too much of the blade is removed at once. This can leave your turf vulnerable and looking uneven.</p>\n\n<h2>Cost Comparison: Weekly vs. Bi-Weekly Service in Chicagoland</h2>\n<p>At first glance, bi-weekly service appears cheaper because you're paying for fewer visits. However, the cost per visit for a bi-weekly mow is often higher than for a weekly one. Taller, thicker grass takes more time, fuel, and wear-and-tear on our equipment to cut properly.</p><p>Think of weekly mowing as an investment in your lawn's health. Over the long term, it often pays off with a more resilient lawn that requires less costly intervention for weed and pest control down the road.</p>\n\n<h2>Chicago-Specific Mowing Considerations</h2>\n<p>Our region's climate presents unique challenges. The heavy, wet springs we often experience can cause explosive grass growth, making weekly mowing almost mandatory to keep up. Conversely, a sudden summer drought might call for switching to a bi-weekly schedule to conserve moisture.</p><p>Furthermore, many Chicago and suburban municipalities have ordinances against overgrown lawns. A bi-weekly schedule can push the limits of these rules, potentially leading to citations if you're not careful.</p>\n\n<h2>Common Mowing Mistakes to Avoid</h2>\n<p>The biggest mistake we see is a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. Sticking to a rigid schedule regardless of rainfall or temperature is detrimental to lawn health. Another common error is cutting the grass too short, which exposes the soil to sunlight and encourages weed growth.</p><p>Finally, using a mower with dull blades tears the grass instead of cutting it cleanly. This creates jagged edges that are susceptible to disease and discoloration, leaving the lawn with a brownish, unhealthy tint.</p>\n\n<h2>DIY vs. Hiring a Professional for Your Illinois Lawn</h2>\n<p>Mowing the lawn yourself seems straightforward, but achieving professional results requires knowledge, consistency, and the right equipment. When you factor in the cost of a quality mower, trimmer, and blower, plus ongoing maintenance and fuel, the investment adds up.</p><p>Hiring a professional service like Uno Pro Services frees up your valuable weekends. More importantly, it puts your lawn in the hands of experts who understand Chicago-area grasses and can adapt the maintenance plan to ensure your lawn thrives all season long.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The debate between weekly and bi-weekly mowing for your Chicago lawn doesn't have a single right answer. For optimal health, appearance, and weed resistance, a weekly schedule is superior, especially in spring and fall. A bi-weekly schedule can work during slower growth periods but comes with risks. The best strategy is an adaptive one that responds to the unique conditions of your property and our local Illinois climate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stop guessing and give your lawn the expert care it deserves.
